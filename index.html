            <p>A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human
                contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.

                <p>Many pet owners say that female cats are quieter, calmer, and less playful than males. Females also
                    tend
                    to be more independent and happy to spend time alone, so a female cat can be a good choice if you'll
                    be
                    out at work all day and just want to be welcomed with a purr when you get home.

                <p> strong bonds with other cats in the home, even when they are not from the same litter. Females, on
                    the
                    other hand, are often more standoffish. If you are looking for a cuddle bug, adopting a male may be
                    your
                    best bet.</p>
